Cafe Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis

This project performs end-to-end data cleaning and basic analysis on a real-world
messy cafe sales dataset using Python.

The focus of the project is on building a correct and honest data cleaning pipeline
rather than blindly filling or guessing values.

Main steps included:
- Normalizing fake missing values (NA, UNKNOWN, ERROR, etc.)
- Fixing incorrect data types (numeric and datetime)
- Handling missing values using logical strategies
- Validating business logic (price per unit × quantity = total spent)
- Standardizing column names and categorical values
- Removing unusable rows while preserving valid data

Basic exploratory analysis and visualizations were created:
- Bar chart showing top 10 items by total revenue
- Pie chart showing revenue share of top 5 items

Tools used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Final outputs:
- Cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_cafe_sales.csv
- Revenue visualizations generated from cleaned data

This project demonstrates a practical data cleaning workflow suitable for
analytics, dashboards, and further data-driven applications.
